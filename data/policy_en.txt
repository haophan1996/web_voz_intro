Last updated: April 25, 2025

VOZvn application ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application ([Your App Name], referred to as "the App"). The App is designed to respect your privacy and does not collect personal information unless you choose to provide it.

1. Information We Collect
No Data Collection by Default: The App does not collect, store, or process any personal information or device data unless you explicitly choose to provide it as described below.

Optional Login: If you choose to log in to the App, you will need to provide an ID and password. This information is used solely to authenticate your access to the App and is securely stored. We do not share or use this information for any other purpose.

Image Saving (Storage Permission): If you choose to save images generated or used within the App, the App may request permission to access your device’s photo storage (read/write access) on Android devices. This permission is required to save images to your device and is not used to access or collect any other data from your photo library or storage.

2. How We Use Your Information
The limited information we collect (ID, password, or storage permission) is used only to:

Authenticate your login, if you choose to use the login feature.
Enable the saving of images to your device, if you grant storage permission.
We do not use your information for marketing, analytics, or any other purpose beyond the functionality of the App.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal information to third parties, except as required by law or to protect the safety and security of our users and the App.

4. Children’s Privacy
The App may be used by individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at [Your Contact Email], and we will take steps to delete such information.

5. Data Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited information we collect (e.g., ID and password) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Your Choices
Login Information: You can choose not to log in to the App, in which case no ID or password will be collected.

Storage Permission: You can deny the storage permission request, but this may limit your ability to save images from the App to your device.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
